# üõ°Ô∏è Cyberimmune Whitepaper: Zero Trust Security Blueprint

## Abstract

This whitepaper presents the Cyberimmune project: a comprehensive, layered cybersecurity framework designed to implement a practical and user-driven Zero Trust model on consumer and professional endpoints. Focused on Windows 11 Enterprise and iOS 18.5, the system uses scriptable hardening, forensic-grade logging, strict access controls, DNS monitoring, and privacy tools to create a ‚Äúdigital immune system‚Äù capable of resisting modern cyber threats.

## Objectives

- Implement practical Zero Trust principles for end-user systems
- Prevent credential theft and persistence via system isolation
- Harden communications using quantum-safe TLS and DNS
- Ensure observability through logging and DNS integrity monitoring
- Provide layered enforcement through VPNs, DNS sinkholes, and root cert validation

## Architecture Overview

### üîπ Phase 1: Baseline System Lockdown
- Disables SMBv1, Remote Desktop
- Enforces SmartScreen, DEP, SEHOP, and CFG
- Limits telemetry to minimum values
- Compatible with Norton or Windows Defender
- Includes: `defender_hardening.ps1`, `norton_compatible_hardening.ps1`

### üîπ Phase 2: Integrity & Anti-Persistence
- Enforces Credential Guard and VBS
- Enables full PowerShell auditing (module/script block)
- Removes Run key persistence and WSH
- Optional BitLocker with AES-256 XTS + PIN at boot
- Includes: `logging_setup.ps1`, `anti_persistence.ps1`, `bitlocker_aes256_pin.ps1`

### üîπ Monitoring & Verification
- Verifies DNSSEC, DNS resolution, and root cert trust
- Scheduled tasks to log anomalies to Event Viewer
- Includes: `check_dnssec.ps1`, `check_dns_integrity.ps1`, `check_root_certs.ps1`, plus XML task templates

## TLS + Time Hardening

In addition to system and host protections, users must apply strong encryption and time validation:

### ‚úÖ Quantum-Safe TLS Hardening
- Run: [`TLS_Hardening.ps1`](https://github.com/collingeorge/QUANTUMREADINESS)
- Enforces TLS 1.2 and 1.3 only
- Enables strong cipher suites
- Enables SchUseStrongCrypto for .NET

### ‚úÖ Secure NTP Configuration
- Run: [`Set-NTPConfig.ps1`](https://github.com/collingeorge/Set-NTPConfig)
- Uses secure NTP pools
- Ensures reliable time sync for cryptographic operations

---

## iOS 18.5 Companion Configuration

- Use ProtonVPN for full-device encryption
- Enforce DNS-over-HTTPS with DNS Override app
- Enable app lock (Face ID/Touch ID)
- Disable permissions on nonessential apps
- Disable untrusted Wi-Fi auto-join

## Zero Trust Security Posture

| Capability                         | Implemented? | Notes                                               |
|-----------------------------------|--------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| Network Trust Elimination         | ‚úÖ Yes        | VPN, DNS override, TLS hardening                   |
| Device Trust Enforcement          | ‚úÖ Yes        | Credential Guard, BitLocker, TPM, Secure Boot       |
| Least Privilege                   | ‚ö†Ô∏è Partial    | Requires additional user rights and UAC control     |
| Visibility & Monitoring           | ‚úÖ Yes        | Logging, Event Viewer, DNS/Cert validation          |
| Identity Verification (2FA)       | ‚úÖ Yes        | Requires 2FA on iOS, Windows, and apps              |
| Certificate & DNS Verification    | ‚úÖ Yes        | Root cert, DNSSEC, and resolution scripts           |
| Remote Access Controls            | ‚úÖ Yes        | RDP disabled, SMB disabled                          |

**Conclusion:** The system achieves a _user-grade_ Zero Trust architecture ‚Äî highly secure, observable, and hardened against compromise. It is comparable in scope to small enterprise or advanced blue team implementations.

## Future Directions

- Phase 3: Network segmentation, DNS sinkholes, VPN kill-switches
- Linux endpoint support (Ubuntu/FIPS)
- LaTeX whitepaper formatting and academic publication
- Integration with compliance standards (CMMC, NIST 800-207)
